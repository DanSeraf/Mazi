I'm trying to implement all of the maze generation algorithms described at [Think Labyrinth!](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) using [Love2D](http://love2d.org/) for visualization.

####TODO:####

1. [ ] Implement all the perfect maze generation algorithms
2. [ ] Create a modular, extensible system of the maze generators
3. [ ] Improve maze visualization
4. [ ] Work on Wiki
5. [ ] Optional: make a small mod for the Legend of Grimrock with random maze generation
6. [ ] Optional: allow user to watch the maze created step by step by each algorithm
7. [ ] Super-optional: make a small game for android about maze solving

####Algorithms####
