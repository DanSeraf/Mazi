I'm trying to impelement all of the maze generation algorithms described at [Think Labyrinth!](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm) using [Love2D](http://love2d.org/) for visualization.

####TODO:####

1. [ ] Create a modular, extensible system of the maze generators
2. [ ] Improve maze visualization
3. [ ] Work on wiki
3. [ ] Optional: make a small mod for the Legend of Grimrock with random maze generation
3. [ ] Optional: allow user to watch the maze created step by step by each algorithm
4. [ ] Super-optional: make a small game for android about maze solving

####Algorithms####

* Perfect
  * [x] Backtracker
  * [x] Recursive backtracker 
  * [x] Prim's algorithm
  * [ ] Kruskal's algorithm
  * [ ] Aldous-Broder algorithm
  * [ ] Wilson's algorithm
  * [ ] Hunt and kill algorithm
  * [ ] Growing tree algorithm
  * [ ] Eller's algorithm
  * [ ] Recursive division
  * [ ] Binary tree Mazes
  * [ ] Sidewinder Mazes
